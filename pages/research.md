<strong>Three-state nematicity in Fe<sub>1/3</sub>NbS<sub>2</sub></strong>

We implementated of a scanning birefrigence microscopy technique to study the magnetic phase transition and nematicitic domain formation in the antiferromagnetic switching material, Fe<sub>1/3</sub>NbS<sub>2</sub>.

<strong>Terahertz Spectroscopy of Proximate Kitaev Spin Liquid Material, α-RuCl<sub>3</sub></strong>

Using a pair of home-built time-domain terahertz spectrometers, we studied the magnetic exciations at zero-wavevector in α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>.

<strong>Unaxial Strain</strong>

In collaboration with MPI, Dresden, I developed hardware to integrate a uniaxial strain device into our optical cryostat. 

<strong>Beam time experience</strong>

Our lab is right next to the Advanced Light Source (ALS)-- as such, throughout grad school I have gotten the opportunity work with staff scientists to collect data on my samples during a few beam time shifts on the micro-laue diffraction, X-ray dichroism, and FTIR beam lines at the ALS.
